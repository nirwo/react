To build a full React application, we need to set up a project structure that includes the React components, services, utilities, and other necessary files. Below is a list of core files and directories that we will create, along with a brief description of their purpose:

- `package.json`: Defines the project dependencies and scripts.
- `public/index.html`: The HTML file that will host our React application.
- `src/index.js`: The entry point for the React application.
- `src/App.js`: The main React component that will serve as the root of our app.
- `src/components/`: Directory for all the reusable React components.
- `src/services/`: Directory for services such as API calls.
- `src/utils/`: Directory for utility functions.
- `src/styles/`: Directory for CSS or other styling files.
- `.gitignore`: To specify files that should not be tracked by Git.

Let's start by setting up the project with `create-react-app`, which will generate the initial project structure and install the necessary dependencies.

First, we need to install `create-react-app` if it's not already installed:

```bash
npm install -g create-react-app
```

Then, we create a new React application:

```bash
npx create-react-app my-react-app
cd my-react-app
```

This will create a new directory `my-react-app` with the initial project structure. Now, let's define the content of each file and directory.

package.json
```json
{
  "name": "my-react-app",
  "version": "0.1.0",
  "private": true,
  "dependencies": {
    "react": "^17.0.2",
    "react-dom": "^17.0.2",
    "react-scripts": "4.0.3",
    "web-vitals": "^1.1.1"
  },
  "scripts": {
    "start": "react-scripts start",
    "build": "react-scripts build",
    "test": "react-scripts test",
    "eject": "react-scripts eject"
  },
  "eslintConfig": {
    "extends": [
      "react-app",
      "react-app/jest"
    ]
  },
  "browserslist": {
    "production": [
      ">0.2%",
      "not dead",
      "not op_mini all"
    ],
    "development": [
      "last 1 chrome version",
      "last 1 firefox version",
      "last 1 safari version"
    ]
  }
}
```

public/index.html
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="utf-8" />
  <link rel="icon" href="%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" />
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1" />
  <meta name="theme-color" content="#000000" />
  <meta name="description" content="Web site created using create-react-app" />
  <title>React App</title>
</head>
<body>
  <noscript>You need to enable JavaScript to run this app.</noscript>
  <div id="root"></div>
</body>
</html>
```

src/index.js
```javascript
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import './index.css';
import App from './App';

ReactDOM.render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <App />
  </React.StrictMode>,
  document.getElementById('root')
);
```

src/App.js
```javascript
import React from 'react';
import './App.css';

function App() {
  return (
    <div className="App">
      <header className="App-header">
        <p>
          Edit <code>src/App.js</code> and save to reload.
        </p>
      </header>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

src/App.css
```css
.App {
  text-align: center;
}

.App-logo {
  height: 40vmin;
  pointer-events: none;
}

.App-header {
  background-color: #282c34;
  min-height: 100vh;
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  align-items: center;
  justify-content: center;
  font-size: calc(10px + 2vmin);
  color: white;
}

.App-link {
  color: #61dafb;
}
```

.gitignore
```
# dependencies
/node_modules
/.pnp
.pnp.js

# testing
/coverage

# production
/build

# misc
.DS_Store
.env.local
.env.development.local
.env.test.local
.env.production.local

npm-debug.log*
yarn-debug.log*
yarn-error.log*
```

This sets up a basic React application structure. From here, you can start adding components, services, and utilities as needed for the specific functionality of your app. Since the requirements for the React app were not specified, this is a generic setup. You can now run `npm start` to start the development server and see your app in action.

To continue, please provide more details about the functionality you want to implement in the React app, and I will provide the corresponding code and file structure.

this concludes a fully working implementation.
